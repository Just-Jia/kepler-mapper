Visuals
==========

There are many ways to visualize your constructed Mapper. The original and most popular method is to use the `KeplerMapper.visualize` function to construct an `.html` file. You can then open this file in your browser and explore the result. If you use Jupyter Notebooks, you can visualize the `.html` file directly in a notebook using the `kmapper.jupyter.display` function. We also provide extensive functionality for constructing Plotly graphs and dashboards using the `kmapper.plotlyviz` module.  To learn more about the Plotlyviz functionality, see the `Jupyter demo`_ or `Plotly demo`_.
